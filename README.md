# MontyHallProblem
The Monty Hall Problem is a gameshow where there are 3 doors presented to the contestant. Behind one door is a car and the other two doors have nothing behind them. The contestant chooses 1 of the doors, which remains unrevealed, and the announcer opens another door to reveal nothing. The contestant is then given the option to stay with the door they initially chose or to switch to the final, unrevealed door. This program will show that it is better to choose the other door to get a higher chance of winning the car.
