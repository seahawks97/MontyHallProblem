# MontyHallProblem
The Monty Hall Problem is a gameshow where there are 3 doors presented to the contestant. Behind 1 is a car and the other 2 have shit behind them. The contestant chooses 1 of the doors, which remains unrevealed, and then another door is revealed to have shit. The contestant is then given the option to stay with the door they initially chose or to switch to the other, unrevealed door. This program will show that it is better to choose the other door to get a higher chance of winning the car.
